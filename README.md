# Timeshifter

This is a commandline tool for shifting date/time values to given timezones and prepare them
for further processing.

Initial intention was to fix timestamps in EXIF data of images. Therefore Timeshifter is
designed to integrate smoothly with
[ExifTool](https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ "ExifTool by Phil Harvey").

For a complete example on how I use it see [Fixing timestamps in EXIF](doc/exifExample.md).

All command line parameters are decribed in [Timeshifter CLI](doc/cli.md).
